        "As [Noam and Nisan (2007)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf) pointed out, a shortcoming of this theory is that it is mostly a nonalgorithmic theory. Thus, the emergence of numerous new markets on the Internet and the availability of massive computational power for running these markets in a centralized or distributed manner has stimulated a need for a new, inherently algorithmic theory of market equilibria. Such algorithms can also help understand the repercussions to existing prices, production, and consumption caused by technological advances, introduction of new goods, or changes to the tax structure. Besides, given the increasing size of data under such situation, especialy for the size of the payoff matrices, the python solution, such as Nashpy approach, carries more computational complexity than nashpy itself. For different requirements under vairous considtions, we should pick corresponding algorithms. In Nashpy, if we want to find all equilibria, support enumeration asspears tp be the best solution and yet is able to return results in realistic time for up to a 10 by 10 size game;if we want to find only one nash equilibria, then Lemke Howosn algorithm can return results reliably for larger games. If you want to look at learned behaviour and potential emergent equilibria then the learning algorithms can handle games of any size (subject to the memory of your machine of course). The precision would depend on whetehr or not the matrices are degenerate.\n",

        "The computational complexity of equilibrium concepts plays a significant role in game theoretic course. The proof that finding a mixed Nash equilibrium is PPAD-complete, which shows the difficulty in finding a Nash quilibrium in some far-fetched, artificial games that happen to encode Brouwer functions, raises doubtes regarding the usefulness of the Nash equilibrium. The PPAD-completeness of Nash suggests that anyapproach to identifying the Nash equilibria that aspires to be efficient, as well as any proposal for using the concept in an applied setting, should expicitly take advantage of computationally beneficial special properties of the games in hand. On the other hand, PPAD-completeness proofs will be eventually refined to cover sipler and more realistic-looking classes of games. \n",

It provides environment for normal form game and repeated game with different approaches to solve and evaluate, including Lemke-Howson algorithm to compute mixed Nash equilibria of a 2-player normal form game, and McLennan & Tourky algorithm to compute mixed Nash equilibria of an N-player normal form game. Besides, it has involved the methods for computing pure Nash equilibria. Italso provides different approaches to computing mixed Nash quilibria of a 2-player normal form game by support enumeration, namely support enumeration and vertex enumertaion. Additionally, the module, bimatrix_generators, contains functions that generate NormalFormGame instances of 2-player games sudied by Fearnley, lgwe, and Savani (2015).\n",

        "Game Theory Explorer (GTE) provides access to the software and the user interface. It is started in a [web browser](http://www.gametheoryexplorer.org) and offers all inetraction via the browser interface. The Game Theory Explorer software allows to create games in extensive or strategic form, and to compute their Nash equilibria, as it is primariy tailored for the applied game theorist who is not an expert in equilibrium computation. The analysis of a game with general mathematical parameters is also aided by knowing its equilibria for specific numerical values of those parameters. \n",

It is fully-across platfrom, and is supported on Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. In terms of functions, it provides a flexible set of operations for constructing and editing general extensive games and has full support for constructing and manipulating arbitrary N-player strategic games and computing Nash equilibria in both extensive and strategic games.\n",
