The Gym library defines a uniform interface for environments what makes the integration between algorithms and environment easier for developers. Among many ready-to-use environments, the default installation includes a text-mode version of the Frozen Lake game, used as example in our last post."

This behavior is completely normal in the Frozen Lake environment because it simulates a slippery surface. Also, this behavior represents an important characteristic of real-world environments: the transitions from one state to another, for a given action, are probabilistic. For example, if we shoot a bow and arrow there’s a chance to hit the target as well as to miss it. The distribution between these two possibilities will depend on our skill and other factors, like the direction of the wind, for example. Due to this probabilistic nature, the final result of a state transition does not depend entirely on the taken action.\n",

        "1.   The understanding of composition within the Frozen-lake environment tends to be necessary. The Frozen-AI environment creates a frozen lake in a grid map, and each grid in the map has a state, namely frozen, hole or goal. Thus, the setting of the environment leads to the discrete action space of the agent. Reaching different states, the agent may be rewarded or punished when in the environment. On the other hand, the agent receives observations through the interactions with the frozen-lake environment, making itself move. We can experiment with the Frozen Lake environment in the open-AI gym through the dichotomy of environment and agent via adjusting the learning strategy (algorithm) of environment and agent. Take the \"sliding\" status, for instance, we can change the environment by setting different probabilities of \"sliding\" and observing the behavior of agents.\n",

        "\n",
        "   The first and foremost principle for lucid communication is standard styling. Starting with the heading, the amount of symbol # indicates various sizes of headings. The styling of words in italics and bolding can be easily written out with asterisks (* for italics, ** for bolding). When quoting someone's saying, we can use block quotes, which come out with a right arrow >. To form nested block quotes, we can apply numerous right arrows. Besides, to express the idea more clearly, we need to tell the story in a standard format with smooth logic. That includes dividing the whole article into different sections and listing out the idea in a specific order (with numbers or bullet points). In terms of code formatting, we can import code when necessary to further demonstrate ideas and improve the interactions. Using proper layout helps readers identify the structure of code - whether they belong together within one single part or they are independent of each other. Another part of making code readable is optimizing its content. We need to polish the content to make the communication more effective and efficient to let what we write to make sense and be reader-friendly, including each element, function, or variable. Additionally, we should involve code comments to clarify the markups, such that chances are good that whenever readers look at the work, they will be able to understand what is going on quite quickly. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. The article can be a great example to tell the whole story. Firstly, it should have a clear logic flow, mainly on how to build the environment and then how to create the game. The article starts with creating the Frozen Lake environment and develops step by step according to the algorithm towards the conclusion. That offers readers an acceptable learning curve when reading the article and makes it easier to digest abstract concepts by explaining them one by one. Secondly, the article has a good structure with different sub-sections. Having got diverse sub-titles for each section, the article successfully improves the readability by breaking a giant goal into small pieces and leaving readers with several small tasks to complete. Thirdly, it illustrates code, hyperlinks, and generated diagrams to make the story more vivid and understandable. That provides readers chances to have a try themselves or to check the results to have a better insight into their concept and given code. The hyperlink also makes the further readings more accessible to readers and improves efficiency. "
